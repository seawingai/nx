# Sea Wing AI - Nx Scaffolding

This repo will serve to increase the rate of adoption of `Nx` and to lower entry barrier. 

It provides pre-configured templates and scaffolding tools to help developers quickly bootstrap modern applications using the Nx monorepo framework. Our goal is to streamline the development process by offering battle-tested configurations and best practices out of the box.
